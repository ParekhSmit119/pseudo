<!-- /QUE.1.What is the default position of an element in CSS?  
 The defult position is position:static;
 It does not get affected by the top, right, bottom, or left properties.
 It appears in the layout exactly where it would naturally be placed within the document, based on the order of elements in the HTML.
 /QUE.2.Explain the difference between `relative`, `absolute`, `fixed`, and `sticky` positioning. 
 Position: Relative is given in parent tag. you can use this property for give position on page.
 Position: absolute is given in child tag. you can use this property for give position on page.
 Position: fixed is given in tag. you can use this property for Fixed div on page.
 Position: sticky is given in tag. you can use this property for Fixed div in the maindiv on page.

 /QUE.3.:-What is `z-index`, and how does it work?  

 -- The z-index property in CSS controls the stacking order of elements on a web page. It determines which elements are displayed in front of or behind others when they overlap.
 -- By default, elements are stacked in the order in which they appear in the HTML. The first element in the HTML will be "under" the next one, and so on.
 --When elements overlap, the element with the higher z-index will be displayed in front of the one with a lower z-index.
 --A number that represents the stacking order. Positive values stack elements in front, negative values send them behind.
  
 /QUE.4.What are the different values of the `overflow` property, and what do they do?  

 --The overflow property in CSS is used to control how content that overflows an element’s box

 Possible Values of the overflow Property:-

 visible (default):-

 --Content is not clipped and will overflow outside the element's box if it doesn't fit.
It allows content to spill out of its container. 
 
hidden:-

The content that overflows the element’s box is clipped and not visible. The overflowed content is simply hidden, and no scrollbars are provided to view it.

 Used when you don’t want to show overflow content at all.

 scroll:-

 The element will always show scrollbars, regardless of whether or not the content overflows. The scrollbars can be used to navigate the overflowed content.
 Used when you want scrollbars to appear in the container for scrolling through content, even if the content doesn’t overflow. This ensures the scrollbars are always visible.


 /QUE.5. When should we use `position: fixed;` instead of `position: absolute;`?

 position: fixed:-

 An element with position: fixed; is positioned relative to the viewport It does not have parent tag.

 It remains fixed in place even when the page is scrolled.

 position: absolute;

 --An element with position: absolute; is positioned relative to the viewport It  have parent tag.
 Position absolute is use to give position child div in the parent tag. 
 when user give absolute to any div that div can not go outside of parent div or which dic user gave position relative.
